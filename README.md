### this isnt the actual project since I will code this in GO.. for now its just a quick log of how it should work...

This being said its entirely possible in Node; however I already know that and I want to make a beefy project in Go to improve my understanding and skills in it.

This could change if stuff like magic, media and any other challenges make it too time consuming.
