### INIT COMMIT: I dont hide anything... Typescript log of how it should work see `doc\.graveyard` I will make this in go.. like jq ...

The concept is a monad style easy to remember file and directory operation pipeline. Its aware of media and various tasks around this concept.
A compile function stores your chains into a profile.

see `doc/.graveyard` for now I won't split it up: until we start the GO conversion... There are some really hard challenges in the arch so far.
When that juncture begins see: this repo: `https://github.com/mattbis/dq-go.tool`

This being said its entirely possible in Node; however I already know that and I want to make a beefy project in Go to improve my understanding and skills in it.

This could change if stuff like magic, media and any other challenges make it too time consuming.
