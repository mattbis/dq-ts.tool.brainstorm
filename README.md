### this isnt the actual project since I will code this in GO.. for now its just a quick log of how it should work...

see `doc/.graveyard` for now I won't split it up: until we start the GO conversion... There are some really hard challenges in the arch so far.
When that juncture begins see: this repo: `https://github.com/mattbis/dq-go.tool`

This being said its entirely possible in Node; however I already know that and I want to make a beefy project in Go to improve my understanding and skills in it.

This could change if stuff like magic, media and any other challenges make it too time consuming.
